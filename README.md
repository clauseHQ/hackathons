# Frequently Asked Questions

## What does Clause do? Why would I use it?

Clause makes it easy for you to build parameterized legal contracts, parse them to extract machine-readable data, execute them as REST services, and connect them to external data sources.

For example, you may have a Service Level Contract that specifies a percentage reduction in a customer's monthly bill, based on the availability of a service. The parameters for the contract are defined in a _smart clause template_ and Clause can be used to automatically generate invoices (or move money!) based on IT monitoring events.

The Clause platform is completely generic and can be used to automate the contractual logic behind any business relationship.
